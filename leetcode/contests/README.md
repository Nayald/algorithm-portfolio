|bi-39|611 / 6047|Q1 no so great, for Q3 I loose a lot of time but I don't know why it work like this and not when the 2 last if are inverted, code is a bit hugly because I try some stuff before without success I invert the 2 as a last hope and it worked ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, not enough time for Q2, I identify it is a DP problem and was thinking about the condition|
