|-|-|-|
|197|7920 / 13984|Very first time|
|199|2760 / 14309||
|202|2713 / 14374||
|bi-33|1405 / 11366|First one with all answered problems|
|203|6307 / 15080||
|204|3591 / 13949||
|207|2499 / 12923||
|210|2825 / 11792|Very disapointed by my performance of this one (unrated)|
|bi-37|808 / 8250|My rank does not feel right or Q3 was excessively hard|
|211|5985 / 11960|Start 18 min late, worst performance ever, even my Q1 is sick. I would have done better to go to sleep instead of pulling an all-nighter for this one|
|bi-39|611 / 6047|Q1 no so great, for Q3 I loose a lot of time but I don't know why it work like this and not when the 2 last if are inverted, code is a bit hugly because I try some stuff before without success I invert the 2 as a last hope and it worked ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, not enough time for Q2, I identify it is a DP problem and was thinking about the condition|
|bi-44|1682 / 8568|Unrated|
|bi-45|2155 / 8426|Unrated|
|bi-49|823 / 9082|Q4 was quite hard, a bit less than 1 hour left to solve it, I think I was not too far from the answer. Else, I lose time because of careless mistakes like forgot modulo 10^9 + 7 and that binomial coefficient with k=2 is just n*(n-1)/2|
|bi-50|358 / 10097|Q1 to Q3 was done in 12 minutes, I forfeit after 1h because Q4 was way too hard for me (reach TLE is trival)|
|bi-52|1536 / 10364|3 stupid wrong submissions that make me lose ~750 places, I tried some ideas on Q4 but still TLE (or MLE)|
