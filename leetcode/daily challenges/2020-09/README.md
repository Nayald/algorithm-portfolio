#  September 2020 LeetCoding Challenge
My submitted solutions, not the best, just the one I write when I solve the problem with no to few improvements (more or less like contests) to better see my improvements
> Any improvements will be done in the full problem set section

## Extra notes
|Number/Day|Complexity|Notes|
