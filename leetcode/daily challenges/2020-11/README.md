#  November 2020 LeetCoding Challenge
My submitted solutions, not the best, just the one I write when I solve the problem with no to few improvements (more or less like contests) to better see my improvements
> Any improvements will be done in the full problem set section

## Extra notes
|Number/Day|Complexity|Notes|

|4||I don't know how to do it without TLE|
|6|N*log(N)|Init left boundary with ⌈sum(nums) / threshold⌉ since we can write sum(nums) / threshold <= d|
|7||Reverse the two lists then add then reverse the result|
